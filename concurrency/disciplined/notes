Things we can do:

* Refactor transitions to function style, making impl easier because we don't have to construct new state.

Pedagogical axes:

A shared nothing
B shared exclusive
C shared r/w locking

J chained table (no stack frames / no h-o-h locking)
K linear probing but lock entire range at once (no h-o-h)
L linear probing (with h-o-h)

* BK -> travis expressed interest (can reference hack-hashtable-wrap)
* CK -> advancing to r/w
AK -> interest of teachability
AJ -> IronSHT
BL -> what e implemented
