PROS

 * Seems extensible
 * Seems feasible to verify something whose complexity is on the order of splinter cache without compromise or modification

CONS

 * Mysterious .s file
 * Difficult way of thinking to teach?

Language support needed

  * ghost, opaque linear resources
  * 'readonly linear'
  * some mechanism for ghost resource transitions on atomic calls
  * compiler support for atomics, pointers
  * classic Dafny 'class' forbidden
