Trying to resurrect interactive plotting infrastructure.
Mystery #1: Where did TimeSeries.py and parser.py go!?
    - There is no trace of them in github.
    - They appear in my 2020-05-06 backup, and are gone by 2020-05-23.

    One explanation: perf-compare.py somehow got onto master, but TimeSeries
    only made it onto an experimental branch. When I switched my local repo
    to master, git helpfully removed it from my local fs for me, which is
    why it's not appearing in the backup.
    ...but then why doesn't it appear in searching github.com?

Mystery #2: How are we generating the summary graphs for the paper / artifact
    eval? It's possible that's a totally orthogonal framework; maybe Andrea
    excised everything matplotlib-ish?
